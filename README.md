## Solo Project: xkcd Comic Website
A website using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) that displays an xkcd comic as well as the some of the comic's information, such as number, title, date, and 'description' (hover over image as on the official xkcd site). The home page displays the comic of the day, and a second page displays a random comic. The second page displays a new comic every time the page is refreshed. Both pages contain a link to the page for the comic on the xkcd website.

## Group Project: The Movie Guru
Another Node website that uses [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/)'s [API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to search for movies or television shows. The search displays the movie/tv poster, title, initial release date, rating, and description. I did the styling for the website as well as editing text and some error checking for the search results.
